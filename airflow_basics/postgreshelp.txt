Let's break down the code you have for the `insert_query` and `for` loop in the `insert_into_table` function:

### Code:

```python
insert_query = """
    INSERT INTO tableone(name, age)
    VALUES(%s, %s)
"""
for customers in data:
    postgress_hook.run(insert_query, parameters=(customers['name'], customers['age']))
```

### What is happening:

1. **`insert_query` Definition:**
   - The `insert_query` is a string that contains an SQL query to insert data into a table called `tableone`. The query is structured as:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO tableone(name, age)
     VALUES(%s, %s)
     ```
     Here:
     - `tableone(name, age)`: Specifies that the data will be inserted into the `name` and `age` columns of the table `tableone`.
     - `VALUES(%s, %s)`: This defines placeholders for the values to be inserted into the `name` and `age` columns. The `%s` placeholders will be replaced by actual values at runtime.

2. **`for customers in data:`**
   - This is a `for` loop that iterates over each element in the `data` list. The `data` list contains dictionaries, and each dictionary represents a customer with two keys: `name` and `age`.
   
   So, for the first iteration, `customers` will be:
   ```python
   {"name": "aaditya", "age": 20}
   ```
   In the second iteration, `customers` will be:
   ```python
   {"name": "ram", "age": 30}
   ```

3. **`postgress_hook.run(insert_query, parameters=(customers['name'], customers['age']))`:**
   - This is the line that actually executes the SQL query.
   - `postgress_hook`: It refers to an instance of the `PostgresHook` object, which is a connection to the PostgreSQL database. It allows you to interact with the database and run queries.
   - `.run()`: This method runs the SQL query defined in `insert_query`.
   - `parameters=(customers['name'], customers['age'])`: The `parameters` argument is used to pass the actual values to replace the `%s` placeholders in the `insert_query`.
     - `customers['name']` gets the `name` value from the current customer (e.g., `"aaditya"`, `"ram"`).
     - `customers['age']` gets the `age` value from the current customer (e.g., `20`, `30`).

   So, for the first iteration:
   ```python
   postgress_hook.run(insert_query, parameters=("aaditya", 20))
   ```
   And for the second iteration:
   ```python
   postgress_hook.run(insert_query, parameters=("ram", 30))
   ```

### In summary:
1. The `insert_query` defines an SQL statement to insert values into the `tableone` table in the `name` and `age` columns.
2. The `for` loop iterates over the `data` list, which contains customer data (name and age).
3. In each iteration, the `PostgresHook.run()` method is called to execute the insert query and insert the actual values (from the current customer) into the table.

This allows you to insert multiple rows into the `tableone` table, one row for each customer in the `data` list.
